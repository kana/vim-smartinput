==============================================================================
INTRODUCTION					*smartinput-introduction*

*smartinput* is a Vim plugin to provide smart input assistant.
Whenever you write a text, especially source code, you have to input and deal
with pairs of punctuations such as (), [], {}, and so on.  This plugin
provides various input assistants for such characters according to the current
context by default, and you can define your own rules to how the smart input
assistant behaves in Insert mode and Command-line mode.

For example, this plugin provides the following rules by default
(note that "#" indicates the cursor position in the following examples):

Complete the corresponding character automatically:

   Before | Input | After   ~
   -------+-------+-------- ~
   #      | (     | (#)
   #      | {     | {#}
   #      | "     | "#"

Leave from the current block easily:

   Before | Input | After   ~
   -------+-------+-------- ~
   (#)    | )     | ()#
   [#]    | ]     | []#
   "foo#" | "     | "foo"#

Undo the completion easily:

   Before | Input | After   ~
   -------+-------+-------- ~
   (#)    | <BS>  | #
   ()#    | <BS>  | #

Care to input strings and regular expressions:

   Before | Input | After   ~
   -------+-------+-------- ~
   \#     | "     | \"#
   \#     | <     | \<#

Care to input English words:

   Before | Input | After   ~
   -------+-------+-------- ~
   let#   | 's    | let's#
   foo(#  | '     | foo('#'

Care to write Lisp/Scheme source code:

   Before | Input | After   ~
   -------+-------+-------- ~
   #      | 'foo  | 'foo#
   "#"    | 'hi   | "'hi#'"

Care to write C-like syntax source code:

   Before       | Input   | After        ~
   -------------+---------+------------- ~
   if (...) {#} | <Enter> | if (...) {
                |         |     #
		|         | }
   if (...)     | <Enter> | if (...)
   {#}          |         | {
		|         |     #
		|         | }

==============================================================================
INTERFACE					*smartinput-interface*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FUNCTIONS					*smartinput-functions*

smartinput#clear_rules()			*smartinput#clear_rules()*
			Clear all defined rules.

smartinput#define_default_rules()	   *smartinput#define_default_rules()*
			Define |smartinput-default-rules|.

smartinput#define_rule({rule})			*smartinput#define_rule()*
			Define a rule for the smart input assistant.
			See |smartinput-rules| for the details of {rule}.

						*smartinput#map_to_trigger()*
smartinput#map_to_trigger({mode}, {lhs}, {rhs-char}, {rhs-fallback})
			Map {lhs} to trigger the smart input assistant for
			{rhs-char} in {mode}.  If there is no proper rule
			for the current context, {rhs-fallback} will be
			inserted instead of {lhs}.

			{lhs}, {rhs-char} and {rhs-fallback} are strings to
			denote key sequences.

			{lhs} is mapped in Insert mode if {mode} is 'i'.
			{lhs} is mapped in Command-line mode if {mode} is 'c'.

			See also |smartinput-exampels| for the details.

smartinput#map_trigger_keys([{overridep}])     *smartinput#map_trigger_keys()*
			Map keys to trigger smart input assistant according to
			rules which are currently defined.
			Existing key mappings are overridden if {overridep} is
			true, otherwise existing key mappings are kept.
			If {overridep} is omitted, it is treated as a false
			value.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
KEY MAPPINGS					*smartinput-key-mappings*

Several characters in Insert mode and Command-line mode are mapped by default
with |smartinput#map_to_trigger()| to trigger the smart input assistant.
See |smartinput-default-rules| for the details.

Set any value to *g:smartinput_no_default_key_mappings*
if you don't want to define the default key mappings.

Each default key mapping will not be defined if the {lhs} is already mapped to
something.  For example, the default key mapping on "(" will not be defined if
you map "(" to something in your vimrc.




==============================================================================
RULES						*smartinput-rules*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
RULE DEFINITION					*smartinput-rule-definition*

Smart input assistants are defined by "rules".  Each "rule" is represented as
a |Dictionary| which contains the following items:

"at" (string) (required)
	Specifies the context to use the smart input assistant.
	This value is treated as a |regular-expression|.
	The smart input assistant will be used if the regular exprssion
	matches to the cursor position.

	Tips: You can use |/\%#| to indicate the cursor position.
	For example, '(\%#)' means that the smart input assistant will be used
	if the cursor is located between parentheses.

	Though |/\%#| works only for matching with the current buffer,
	you can still use it for "at" to specify the cursor position in
	Command-line mode.

"char" (string) (required)
	Specifies a character to trigger the smart input assistant.

"input" (string) (required)
	Specifies a result of the smart input assistant.
	This value is used like {rhs} for |:map| commands.
	This value is inputted instead of the "char" value.

"mode" (string) (optional)
	Specifies the context to use the smart input assistant.
	This value is a string of characters to represent modes in which the
	smart input assistant will be used.  Valid characters and
	corresponding modes are as follows:

	Character	Mode			~
	---------	-----------------	~
	i		Insert mode
	:		Command-line mode for normal Ex commands
	>		Command-line mode for |debug-mode| commands
	/		Command-line mode for serching with |/|
	?		Command-line mode for serching with |?|
	@		Command-line mode for |input()|
	-		Command-line mode for |:insert| or |:append|

	The default value is 'i'.

"filetype" (list of strings) (optional)
	Specifies the context to use the smart input assistant.
	This value is a list of 'filetype' names like "lisp", "scheme" etc.
	The smart input assistant will be used if:
	
	- This item is not given, or
	- The current buffer's 'filetype' equals one of this value.

	If 'filetype' is a compound one which has two or more names
	concatenated by ".", each name will be tested instead of the whole
	value of 'filetype'.

	This specification works only for Insert mode.

"syntax" (list of strings) (optional)
	Specifies the context to use the smart input assistant.
	This value is a list of syntax names like "Comment", "Constant" etc.
	The smart input assistant will be used if:
	
	- This item is not given, or
	- The cursor position is highlighted as one of this value.

	See also |group-name| for examples of available values.
	Note that only "wide" syntax items are effective.  In other words,
	syntax items which is linked to another is not effective, and they
	will never be matched.  For example:

	* "Constant" is effective because it is not linked to anything.
	* "String" is not effective because it is linked to "Constant".
	* "lispString" is not effective because it is linked to "String".

	This specification works only for Insert mode.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DEFAULT RULES					*smartinput-default-rules*

For convenience, there are many rules defined by default.  And it's hard to
list and to describe each rule here, because the default rules will be often
updated.

See |smartinput-introduction| for a short digest of the default rules.

See the source code of |smartinput#define_default_rules()| for the details:
- If you read this document in Vim,
  open ../autoload/smartinput.vim (type |gf| at the file name).
- If you read this document with a Web browser, open the following:
  https://github.com/kana/vim-smartinput/blob/master/autoload/smartinput.vim


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PRIORITIES					*smartinput-rule-priorities*

Rules have priorities.  It is used to select the best rule for the smart input
assistant.

Rule priorities are calculated as follows:

(a) "at" length.
(b) 100 / {the number of elements} if "filetype" is given.
    0 if "filetype" is not given.
(c) 100 / {the number of elements} if "syntax" is given.
    0 if "syntax" is not given.
(d) 100 / {the length of "mode"}.

Rule priority = (a) + (b) + (c) + (d)

For example:

	{'at': '\%#', 'char': "'", 'input': "''\<Left>"} ~
		(a) 3
		(b) 0
		(c) 0
		(d) 100 / 1 = 100
		Priority = 3 + 0 + 0 + 100 = 103

	{'at': '\%#', 'char': "'", 'input': "'", ~
	 'filetype': ['lisp', 'scheme']} ~
		(a) 3
		(b) 100 / 2 = 50
		(c) 0
		(d) 100 / 1 = 100
		Priority = 3 + 50 + 0 + 100 = 153

	{'at': '\%#', 'char': "'", 'input': "'", ~
	 'filetype': ['lisp', 'scheme'], ~
	 'syntax': ['Comment', 'Constant']} ~
		(a) 3
		(b) 100 / 2 = 50
		(c) 100 / 2 = 50
		(d) 100 / 1 = 100
		Priority = 3 + 50 + 50 + 100 = 203


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
RULE SELECTION ALGORITHM		 *smartinput-rule-selection-algorithm*

Whenever you type a key in Insert mode or Command-line mode, the plugin
selects the best rule for the current context with the following steps:

(1) Select available rules which satisfy all the following conditions:

    (c) "char" value is equal to the typed key.
    (a) The text under the cursor is matched to "at" pattern.
    (f) The 'filetype' of the current buffer is contained in "filetype" list,
        or "filetype" list is omitted,
	or the current mode is not Insert mode.
    (s) The character at the cursor is highlighted as one of "syntax" names,
        or "syntax" names are omitted,
	or the current mode is not Insert mode.
    (m) The current mode matches to "mode" value.

(2) If two or more rules are selected at the step (1),
    select the rule with the highest |smartinput-rule-priority|.

(3) If two or more rules are selected at the step (2),
    select the rule with the greatest "at".
    Note that this step is just to avoid unstable selection.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
RULE CONVENTIONS				*smartinput-rule-conventions*

Like |i_<BS>| and |i_CTRL-H|, there are several keys which does the same
effects.  If you want to define rules for such keys,

* Use the most descriptive keys for "char"s of rules.
* Map other keys to trigger rules for the descriptive keys.

For example, if you want to define rules on both |i_<BS>| and |i_CTRL-H|,

* Define rules only for <BS>.
* Map <C-h> to trigger rules for <BS>, with the following command:
>
	smartinput#map_to_trigger('<C-h>', '<BS>', '<C-h>')
<
This convention is to avoid rule duplication.  See also the following table:

"char" keys | Mapped keys                    ~
------------+------------------------------- ~
<BS>        | <C-h>
<Enter>     | <C-m> <C-j> <CR> <NL> <Return>
<Esc>       | <C-[>
<Tab>       | <C-i>




==============================================================================
CUSTOMIZATION					*smartinput-customization*

(A) To define your own |smartinput-rules| for the smart input assistant,
    use |smartinput#define_rule()|.  See also |smartinput-default-rules| for
    the real world examples.

(B) If you define your own |smartinput-rules| which "char" values are
    different from ones of |smartinput-default-rules|, you have to define
    trigger keys for your own rules with |smartinput#map_to_trigger()| or
    |smartinput#map_trigger_keys()|.




==============================================================================
BUGS						*smartinput-bugs*

- Still this plugin is not mature, there might be problematic behaivor and
  missing features.  If you find any problem or have any suggestion, please
  give your feedback to the author via:
  https://github.com/kana/vim-smartinput/issues

- Though there are many default rules to support user input naturally, the
  smart input assistant is not perfect.  It sometimes completes quotes etc
  where such completion is not necessary.  In that case, use |i_CTRL-V| to
  input a character solely.  For example, type "<C-v>(" to input only "(".




==============================================================================
CHANGELOG					*smartinput-changelog*

0.0.2	2012-04-01T16:11:14+09:00		*smartinput-changelog-0.0.2*
	- Revise the default rules to easily leave from multiline {}, [] and
	  () blocks.  Thanks to Curtis McEnroe for the suggestion.
	- Revise the default rules for escaped ' and rules to leave from a ''
	  block.  The former is used by default, and the latter is used only
	  for specific languages which \ doesn't have special meanings in ''
	  blocks, for example, Perl, Ruby, shell script and Vim script.
	  Thansk to Andrew Ray for the suggestion.

0.0.1	2012-03-30T19:38:53+09:00		*smartinput-changelog-0.0.1*
	- Fix side effects in the default configuration.  <C-h> in
	  Command-line mode did not update the screen immediately.
	- Add the default rules to input triple quotes such as '''...''',
	  """...""" and ```...```, for Python, Markdown, etc.
	- Add the default rules to easily comment to edit Vim script.  Because
	  |:comment| in Vim script starts with " while string literals are
	  quoted with ".  Now " is completed only if the current context is to
	  input string literals.

0.0.0	2012-02-09T22:35:02+09:00		*smartinput-changelog-0.0.0*
	- Initial version.
