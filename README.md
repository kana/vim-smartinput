# Panacea
What does this plugin do? It auto-completes your input as you type, without asking you for permission or giving you options. Think of it like a more aggressive version of `snipmate`! "And how is that a good thing?", you may ask. Well, let me ask you this:

- Do you like when your editor auto-completes matching parentheses and brackets for you?
- Do you like when your editor auto-indents stuff for you (assuming it gets it right)?
- Do you like when your editor automatically determines that there should be a semicolon at the end?
- Do you like when your editor spaces things correctly for you (based on language best practices)?
- Do you like when your editor auto-aligns things?
- Do you like when your editor lets you quickly jump out of a block you're in (without leaving insert mode)?
- Do you like when your editor auto-completes your code patterns?
- Do you like when your editor helps you with code conventions automatically?
- Do you keep forgetting which language conventions ask for camelCase and which ask for snake_case?
- Do you like when your backspace is smart enough to undo the macro you may have unintentionally triggered?
- Do you want a single plugin to give vim all those type-completion features that your friend gets for free with Sublime/Atom?
- Do you want to one-up that Sublime/Atom friend?

If you answered "yes" to any of the above, you, my friend, probably want this plugin (cheesy car salesman grin).
